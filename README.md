# No Menu Slowdown

Prevents time slowing down when the log, weapon wheel, or the satchel is open. It is like vStar925's No Weapon Wheel Slowdown 1.0.0 mod but it does not require Cheat Engine. The only difference between this mod and his, is that the background overlay shows up when the menus are open and that this mod affects 2 more menus.
